# Summary

The Decentralized Credential Exchange (DCX) project creates a new DWeb Node procotol to facilitate the decentralized exchange of credentials between applicants and issuers. The DCX protocol is open and permissionless leveraging the benefits of DWeb Nodes, Verifiable Credentials and many other powerful Web5 primitives.

The DCX project is a perfect fit for the consumer lending industry. Leveraging DCX would make this process more efficient and secure benefiting all actors in the flow of applying for a mortgage loan: borrowers, lenders and data verifiers. DCX achieves this by leveraging the strengths of Web5 -- specifically, the power of VCs.

Benefits to Borrowers

- Empowers borrowers with 100% ownership and control over their identity and financial data
- Allows borrowers to sell that data directly to the "highest bidder" forcing lenders to be more competitive
- Provides borrowers with a list of lenders that appropriately match their need to more effectively find and vet loan offers
- Reduces time spent on loan applications as well as reducing borrowers' exposure to identity theft
- Corrects long standing biases in lending, and improve financial inclusion and financial literacy

Benefits to Lenders

- Provides lenders with highly qualified borrowers who meet their specific needs
- Reduces cost per acquisition for lenders and increase the value of each acquired lead
- Reduces lenders' need to perform necessary, tedious and costly loan application data gathering and processing

Benefits to Aggregators

- Helps loan application data providers (VC providers) monetize their services more efficiently

DCX strengthens the Web5 ecosystem by introducing a credential real-world use case for protocol development. We expect this will tighten the feedback loop for both Web5 and tbDEX development, allowing Web5 FOSS engineering groups to benefit from the contributions of DCX participants.

By participating in the DCX protocol, all three participant groups will receive more volume and higher quality services at more competitive prices all thanks to data sovereignty provided by the Web5 platform resulting in a completely open and competitive data market place.

## Preview

DCX is an open source, permissionless software protocol designed to facilitate the decentralized exchange of credentials among applicants, verifiers and issuers. An example application could be the consumer lending industry. Here, DCX could bringing the network effects, competitive markets, and data sovereignty of Web5. While consumer lending will be the first industry where DCX will be applied, the protocol's abstract nature can be applied to any context that requires multiple parties exchanging data that must be verified.
