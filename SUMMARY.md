# Summary

The Decentralized Credential Exchange (DCX) project is both a protocol and a software package.

The protocol is open and permissionless, built atop the Web5 Platform. The package is a free, and open-source npm package with Web5 built into it. Together, they bring the network effects, competitive markets, and data sovereignty of Web5 to the consumer lending industry.

The DCX project will first be applied to the consumer lending industry providing a myriad of improvements for all those involved: borrowers, lenders and data aggregators. DCX achieves these improvements by leveraging the strengths of Web5 -- specifically, the power of Verifiable Credentials (VCs). There are 16.7M Americans who can provably service a loan but are excluded based on credit scores alone. Borrowers participating in DCX will hold VCs that indicate not just their credit score but also their Ability to Pay (ATP) score -- a metric used in place of status quo credit reporting systems. ATP unlocks financial sovereignty for more people and helps borrowers more effectively monitor their financial health.

Benefits to Borrowers
- Empowers borrowers with 100% ownership and control over their identity and financial data
- Allows borrowers to sell that data directly to the "highest bidder" forcing lenders to be more competitive
- Provides borrowers with a list of lenders that appropriately match their need to more effectively find and vet loan offers
- Reduces time spent on loan applications as well as reducing borrowers' exposure to identity theft
- Corrects long standing biases in lending, and improve financial inclusion and financial literacy

Benefits to Lenders
- Provides lenders with highly qualified borrowers who meet their specific needs
- Reduces cost per acquisition for lenders and increase the value of each acquired lead
- Reduces lenders' need to perform necessary, tedious and costly loan application data gathering and processing

Benefits to Aggregators
- Helps loan application data providers (VC providers) monetize their services more efficiently

DCX strengthens the Web5 ecosystem by introducing a credential real-world use case for protocol development. We expect this will tighten the feedback loop for both Web5 and tbDEX development, allowing Web5 FOSS engineering groups to benefit from the contributions of DCX participants.    
    
By participating in the DCX protocol, all three participant groups will receive more volume and higher quality services at more competitive prices all thanks to data sovereignty provided by the Web5 platform resulting in a completely open and competitive data market place. Early participants in DCX protocol include MX.com, Sophtron.com and FormFree.com.
