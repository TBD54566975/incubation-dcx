/**
 * Interface for interacting with the resumable task store.
 *
 * Implementer's Note:
 * The store implementation used in a horizontally scalable deployment, such as in a Kubernetes cluster,
 * must account for concurrent access by multiple `ResumableTaskStore` instances.
 * It would be undesirable to have many kubernetes pods all trying to handle the same resumable task.
 * A minimal viable implementation can use a per tenant exclusive lock on the store when `grab()` and  method is called.
 * This would prevent issues that occur from concurrent modification to the same task to the store,
 * but negatively impacts the throughput performance of the DWN.
 * Requirements for a more performant implementation that allows distributed processing of resumable tasks across multiple clients:
 * 1. The implementation probably requires both:
 *   a. a persistent store for storing the data of each resumable task; and
 *   b. an message streaming queue/service for distributing the each task exclusively to one of multiple handling clients.
 * 2. The `grab()` and/or `open()` implementation will need to copy the timed-out tasks from persistent store into the message queue/service
 *    for distributed processing by multiple clients when there is no resumable tasks to grab in the message queue.
 *    During the move, the persistent store should be locked to prevent multiple copies of the same tasks from being copied.
 * 3. Both Google's pub-sub and Amazon's SQS require an Ack ID / Receipt Handle to acknowledge the message,
 *    The value of Ack ID / Receipt Handle is not known until the message is received,
 *    therefore the implementer will likely need to have an in-memory mapping of task ID -> Ack ID / Receipt Handle
 *    so that `delete()` can be called with task ID.
